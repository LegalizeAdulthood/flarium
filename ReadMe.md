# Flarium

Flarium is an interactive fractal generating program for Windows
written by Stephen C. Ferguson in the 1990s.

This repository was created to archive the source code on github
from the source as originally distributed in ZIP files.

The source code has been updated to build under Visual Studio 2022
Community Edition with the optional MFC components installed.
